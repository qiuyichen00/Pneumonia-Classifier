1. Data Augmentation
Need lots of time to try out different combinations, need patience.


2. Reduce the size of model
At first, didn't even realize that the issue exists (Before never deployed the model as web app). First challenge is the
model weights file is way too large for the maximum file size (100 Mb for github). After fail to find other methods (like
zip, different file format), find one layer in model has significantly more parameters than others, then enlightened by Res40
net, use Global Average Pooling layer to dramatically reduce the dimension.
